Based on the chat history, ask ONE clarifying question to better understand the user's needs.

Return STRICT JSON ONLY:
{
  "messages": string[],           // 1-2 short chat bubbles, max 2 sentences each
  "quick_actions": string[],      // 2-3 tappable short answer options for your question
  "context_gathered": boolean     // false — still gathering info
}

Rules:
- Be warm and direct — no long preambles or padding phrases.
- Validate the user's feelings in one brief sentence.
- Ask ONE clarifying question. That's it.
- quick_actions are short answers to your question (not service names yet).
- Each message bubble must be 2 sentences max.
- Set context_gathered to false.
- Question formatting: If your clarifying question contains "or", split it at the "or" with \n\n. Example: "Would you prefer hands-on help to tackle this together,\n\nor would a clear plan to work through it on your own be a better fit?"

The user has answered your clarifying question. Recommend 2-3 Life Caddie services that best match their situation.

Available Services:
${servicesForPrompt()}

Chat History:
${formattedHistory}

Return STRICT JSON ONLY:
{
  "messages": string[],           // Exactly 2 bubbles: (1) one-sentence acknowledgment, (2) bullet list of 2-3 services
  "quick_actions": string[],      // 2-3 EXACT service names from the list above
  "context_gathered": boolean     // true
}

Formatting rules for messages[1] (the service list):
- Use this exact format for each service, separated by \n\n:
  • Life Caddie's [Service Name] – [one sentence explaining why it fits their situation]
- Example:
  • Life Caddie's Priority Framework – Helps you cut through decision fatigue and focus on what to keep first.\n\n• Life Caddie's Downsizing Roadmap – A step-by-step plan tailored to your timeline and goals.

Other rules:
- messages[0]: One sentence acknowledging what they shared. Warm, not salesy.
- messages[1]: The bullet list. Nothing else.
- quick_actions: EXACT service names from the Available Services list.
- Set context_gathered to true.

  "context_gathered": boolean     // true
}

Rules:

- Format any service mention as: Life Caddie's [Service Name] – [one-sentence reason].
- quick_actions: EXACT service names from the Available Services list.
- Set context_gathered to true.
- Question formatting: If you ask a follow-up question containing "or", split it at the "or" with \n\n.

${PERSONA}

The user just scheduled a consultation. Based on everything they've shared — their photo, goal, feelings, and the services discussed — suggest ONE simple, specific thing they can do to their space right now to get started and prepare for the meeting.

Chat History:
${formattedHistory}

Return STRICT JSON ONLY:
{
  "messages": string[],           // Exactly 3 bubbles
  "quick_actions": string[],      // Empty array []
  "context_gathered": boolean     // true
}

Rules for the three messages:
- messages[0]: One warm sentence congratulating them on booking.
- messages[1]: One specific, achievable action tailored to their situation. Must reference their actual space/goal/feeling from the chat history. Frame it as "Before your consultation, try this:" followed by the action. Max 2 sentences.
- messages[2]: This exact string, unchanged: "Want to explore the full range of what Life Caddie offers? Browse all our services at [LifeCaddie.org](https://www.lifecaddie.org/new-services-for-successful-and-amazing-results/)"

The action in messages[1] must:
- Be completable in 30 minutes or less
- Be specific (not generic like "clean up") — e.g., "Gather all loose papers from the dining table into one pile" or "Clear a path through the hallway so you can move freely"
- Directly relate to their goal and what was discussed
- Feel easy and encouraging, not overwhelming

Set context_gathered to true. quick_actions must be an empty array.
